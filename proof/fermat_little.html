      Proof of Fermat's Little Theorem
    </h3>
    <p>
      <b>Statement:</b> If $p$ is a prime number and $a$ is an integer such that $a\not\equiv 0\pmod p$ then $a^{p-1}\equiv 1\pmod p$
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Proof:</b> Consider the set $S = \{a, 2a, 3a, ..., (p-1)a\}$. The $k^{th}$ element of this set (i.e $ka$) will leave a least residue between $1$ & $(p-1) \pmod p$. This is because every member of $S$ is formed by the product of $a \times \{1, 2, 3, ..., (p-1)\}$, and since $a\not\equiv0\pmod p$ by definition and $\{1, 2, 3, ..., (p-1)\}$ is the least residue system of $p$, therefore no member of $S$ is $0\pmod p$.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every element of $S$ will leave a unique least residue $\pmod p$. Assume this were not the case and elements $ka$ and $ja$ leave the same residue, i.e assume $ka\equiv ja\pmod p$. But this just implies $k \equiv j\pmod p$. Since both $k \lt p$ & $j \lt p$, this implies that $k = j$; i.e no two elements of $S$ can leave the same least residue, i.e. the least residues left behind by members of $S \pmod p$ will be some permutation of the least residue system. This implies that the product of all members of $S$ will be congruent to the least residue system $\pmod p$. i.e
      $$\prod_{k=1}^{p-1} ka \equiv \prod_{k=1}^{p-1} k \pmod p$$
      Collecting all the $a$ terms in the L.H.S we get:
      $$a^{p-1}\prod_{k=1}^{p-1} k \equiv \prod_{k=1}^{p-1} k \pmod p$$
      Cancelling out the contribution of $\prod_{k=1}^{p-1}k$, we get our required result:
      $$a^{p-1} \equiv 1\pmod p$$
